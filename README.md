# 🐍🪜 Agile Katas - Snakes & Ladders

**A TypeScript implementation of the Snakes and Ladders Kata.**

*[Snakes and Ladders Kata - Agile Katas](https://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/SnakesAndLadders-Kata)*

----
## Notes
- An OOP implementation was chosen over a Functional Programming one, due to some benefits which it provides, namely:
    - More encapsulation
    - Less state management
    - Ability to inherit classes for future functionality
- The longest part of this was setting up Node with nvm from scratch on my personal laptop... 😅
- I initially arrived at a somewhat overly complicated solution for mocking values in the `game.ts` logic, but slowly realised it's better to keep things really simple and straightforward
